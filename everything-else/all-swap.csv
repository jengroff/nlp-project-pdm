Hermès Kelly cut, YSL raffia bag, Hermès Kelly to go, Bolide mini, Kelly 28 sellier canvas",Timeless and ageless styles are the main reason I shop for the luxury fashion brands. For example I feel always so proud and happy to carry my 20+years handbags from Hermès ( Kelly 35 sellier to be specific). Hermès also releases some new styles of handbags but they usually variate in sizes ( minis are very hot now). I used to love Louis Vuitton but as they explore too many styles in printing ( monogram with some designs) I began to avoid such items as I feel carrying them is outdated.

My Fave!,"When I was a little girl I used to imagine myself walking down Fifth Avenue and looking into the windows at Tiffany’s and Saks Fifth Avenue. I dreamt of one day being able to wear what I saw in the windows. Today I am still that little girl but I am now wearing the things I used to imagine.  What differentiates designer clothing from other fashion brands is how it makes you feel when you put it on or carry, the workmanship that is behind what you are putting on or carrying, and the fabric/materials used by the designers. Saying that what is luxury to one is not luxury to another. It is a personal preference – for me it is always being that little girl imagining what could be when looking into  the windows at Tiffany’s and Saks Fifth Avenue."

Hermes and Chanel are still independent which shows in its quality and value retention.

When I buy a Birkin it’s going to keep, if not double or triple in value. When I buy a YSL Tote I’m losing my money and the item will soon be out of style.

Same with Chanel Classics. The price may be INSANE but the item will last for years and so will the style. I cannot say the same for Chloe, Givenchy, Gucci or Dolce and Gabbana Bags."

I also love VIP treatment of SA’s and the houses themselves to clients like us. We are often made to feel special and important whenever we shop, answering all our questions and being patient with us, especially during the pandemic when going to the store was not possible. Talking or texting my SA helped a lot! Luxury brands also know how to zhush up their Classic collections based on trends with limited-editions and collabs!

Other fashion brands come and go for me, and I don’t expect to wear them for more than a season or two. In the last 5 years, I have tried really hard not to buy other brands and only use it to fill a void which designer brands don’t have such as a plain white T or denim or a passing trend."

I also love that when you purchase a luxury clothing item not everyone is wearing it--I like to have my own kind of style and enjoy wearing pieces that are not as easy to come by. Designers aren't mass producing these items. And they are made more personally. Stitching by hand, almost like it's made just for me. If that makes sense."
Heather Wilcox,Gucci track suit,Chanel Icon Beige Clair,"The unique touches such as the type and placement of hardware or a design/pattern indicating within which season it was purchased.

So even when they sell something casual, like T shirts or even a pair of socks, I would trust them with their quality as well as the design and after-care. Yes, they are more expensive so people might think they’d better be good, and in most cases in my opinion they actually are more than good. They are the top runner of the trend, they have pride and belief in their products and their passion to please and satisfy their clients always impress me and make me want to go back to the same brands."

The quality is typically higher than everyday to mid price brands.

Third being service: there is an expectation of a higher level of service from luxury brands than everyday brands."
Linda Law,,,"Quality of products. ""Limited"" - do not want to spend $$$ if everyone can buy."
Lisa Goodrich,Isabel Marant top,Chanel handbag,"Exclusivity - the item I buy won't be easy to find or for others to find. Quality - the construction will be the finest and made to last a long time. Taste - the item will be one that will be in good taste even if it is avant garde or not yet in fashion. Uniqueness - the item will reflect a certain style or aesthetic that the particular brand is known for and will be in character with the identity of the brand. Splurge - the item will be more expensive than other items and will add a feeling of luxe that will elevate any outfit. Overall brand identity - the brand will carefully curate its messaging so that I will feel proud to be associated with the brand and those that wear it.
Inventiveness - the brand will seek to explore new ideas and styles, and to set the trends years in advance, and will not be content to simply follow the mainstream. Design - the item will be designed to feature thoughtful details and features that are unique and will be useful to or delight the wearer. Experience - the experience of purchasing the item will be a pleasure from start to finish, from stepping into the store, whether to browse or ultimately purchase. There is a feeling that the brand seeks to build a lasting relationship to which the buyer wants to return again and again, not a short term sales transaction."

Luxury fashion sources the best materials to create the product. These materials have a more pleasing feel and look, longevity and wear better than non-luxury brands. The design aspects of luxury stems from the creative minds at the helm of the various fashion brands. Luxury fashion creates the look while non-luxury follows the look. Quality of construction and fit sets apart luxury fashion from the rest. Luxury items are made with care and it shows from the pattern, fit and finish...just doesn't compare. Finally, service delivery and relationship building is at the core of luxury. The presentation of the final product and treatment of clientele creates an experience. Luxury shopping should be an experience of enjoyment and echo the brands' overall image and be relatable to the client."

Luxury brands like Hermès prides itself with only giving the highest quality products, most of them handmade by an artisan, guaranteeing the best of the best. Luxury brands tend to stand the test of time, retaining its value over time (or in the case of Chanel and Hermes classics, value increases in time). It also means exclusivity and tend to have a smaller but more discerning following. Luxury brand aficionados love the heritage/history of each house and appreciate all the hard work that goes into it. Other fashion brands on the other hand are like fast fashion, they cater to trends, what sells now. The quality is not that great, most are mass produced,  and very accessible to everyone. Fashion brands tend to cater to seasonality anf trends, something you can enjoy for months or a few years (depending on the quality). For fashion brands, the heritage/history does not matter as much."

Stacey Kontoh,Chanel trousers,Hermes Birkin,The fact that it’s exclusive and mostly harder to get due to it’s usually higher price points. There is also much more attention to detail and better craftsmanship secondary to the fact that it’s usually handmade as opposed to mass produced.
Stephanie  Carroll,Burberry Camel Coat,Chanel Medium 19 Lambskin,A luxury fashion brand offers a quality and style above and beyond what you will find at a “typical” retailer. The designers at prestigious fashion houses are creating pieces of art so when I add to my collection it is more than just a garment or accessory.
Stephanie Holloway,Balenciaga Dress,Ysl denim Lou Lou,"To me, the difference between luxury fashion and regular fashion is the quality and the exclusivity. Luxury items have a longer life because they are made better and designers stand behind their items, so if there is a problem they are more apt to make it right. Fashion is everywhere but luxury isn't and that's why I love it."

A luxury fashion brand have beautiful boutique where you don’t just shop, you get to experience the brand lifestyle. In addition, the items sold by luxury brands are high quality, hard to acquire (price, rarity), and only sold in boutiques. The packaging is beautiful. They take care of their customers and stand behind their products. You don’t get that from non luxury brands."
Tawanda Starms,,,My experience has been the quality is better and the styles are classic/timeless which works well for my style. I tend to buy clothes that aren’t trendy and shoes that tend to be the “WOW” factor. I also like the exclusivity of buying from luxury brands. Not everyone owns what I have.

Amy Luck,Chanel dress,Chanel rainbow mini,"To me, a luxury brand is brand that has withstand the test of time and is iconic. Iconic in the sense that when you look at a piece of item, you can easily identify the brand. Some great examples of that would be the Chanel classic flap, Louboutins red sole, the Lonchamp tote, and Mulberry bayswater. The second important factor for me is quality. It has to be made to last and the item must have flawless craftsmanship. These are the two things that are important to me when it comes to luxury brands."
Amy R.  Cohen,Chanel Leather Jacket,Louis Vuitton Bags,"A luxury brand is about craftsmanship, exclusivity, a feeling of belonging to a club that not everyone can belong to. When you wear them, you’re treated with respect and when you shop for them, you’re treated to an experience. Sales Associates know you by name and know what you like. You see others carrying the same brand and it is like they are in the know. You do not get that feeling with regular brands."

Chelsea Jia,Christian Dior jacket,Christian Dior Bobby bag,"The most important quality that differentiates a fashion brand is the overall feel of the brand. What style or image are they trying to portray through the combined collection of bags, clothes, shoes, etc? That’s an important question. I also think having an original and unique style also is important. For example, I’ve seen a few brands copy Hermès Kelly or Chanel classic flap and it makes me feel like this brand that copies others hasn’t really matured yet. Finally, I consider investment value. I’m always updating my closet and my style has changed from my 20s to early 30s. I never buy with the intention to sell, but I am conscious that my style might be in the middle of changing so I keep abreast of how easily the bag sells and whether or not it can hold its value.
Recently I’ve noticed handbag quality of brands like Chanel and Hermès have been inconsistent. It’s made me reconsider paying a premium. If I want a green bag, I may just buy a different brand. I find dior and fendi to be “edgier” now"
Cherie Obilom,Dior pant set,Bottega cassette bags,The craftsmanship/quality. The history. The unique and distinctive designs that catch people’s eye when you’re walking by. The feeling you get knowing you’re wearing something not everyone has. It’s all about exclusivity isn’t it??

The craftsmanship will continue to make me a collector for life!"
Christine Go,Burberry,"Balenciaga
Goyard","The main differentiating factor of a luxury fashion brand is the quality of product that you are receiving. Simply touching a designer leather purse, you can feel how soft the high quality material is compared to any other brand. The luxury brands have a well-established reputation of providing superior products and innovative design that other brands can not provide. Every little detail, such as the seamwork of an article of clothing, is executed so perfectly that the items are more durable (if treated appropriately). The luxury brands also offer the individual a sense of status and uniqueness."
Courtenay Lowe,Fendi sweater I bought in February,Fendi block heels i bought last weekend snd Dior purse i bought in December,"The brand strategy for luxury brands is different than other fashion brands. Luxury doesn’t meet a need or solve a problem, and so it is intrinsically wrong to position a luxury brand based on how it compares to its competitors. Luxury consumers aren’t interested in more features giving better value for money – that’s a premium marketing angle. Luxury consumers want to know about a brand’s heritage, prestige and uniqueness; it’s identity which counts, rather than a competitive edge."
Courtney Bartelstein,Stella Mccartney jumpsuit,"Prada boots, gucci sneakers",The quality of the item. The clothing/bag/ shoes stays in optimal condition and always looks brand new. They are pieces that I always look forward to wearing and feel confident in.

Cynthia Esumei,Balmain blazer,Hermès birkin,"A designer clothing, shoe, handbag, and jewelry are made with quality materials. They hold their value, are noticeable as they convey a sense of wealth, and exclusivity. As far as selling, designer items hold their value as opposed to non designer items"
Daniella Saeedian,Fendi blouse,Saint Laurent handbag,"A luxury fashion brand offers quality that is far superior to the quality offered by ordinary brands. When purchasing a luxury product, you know that they stand by their product and you can receive help in the event that your item is damaged/breaks. Also, when purchasing luxury goods at a store you know you will get top notch service."

eleonora zeltser,Saint Laurent jacket,Chanel bag and chanel sneakers,The exclusivity of luxury brands is everything. Because some luxury items are hard to get and find easily in stores is why I want them. It’s different from fashion brands that available everywhere.
Ella Brodskaya,Fendi Bathing Suit,Chanel mules,Value in the brand. Luxury items are something that hold their value really well. We’ve seen this with a lot of styles resurfacing (ie Prada re-edition and dior saddle are both bags I had in high school and now I’m in my 30s and they’re back in style). The quality is long lasting and something I would hope to pass on to my daughters one day. Luxury items are classics and never go out of style like trendy items and they carry sentimental value. For instance I have a silk Oscar de la renta scarf my mom passed down to me. One day I hope she will also let go of her lady dior bag!
Emily Zaghi,Balenciaga jacket,YSL Kate bag,I believe that quality and elegance of luxury brands are what makes them different. Luxury fashion brands are typically trend setters and other brands follow from them so I enjoy the originality
Fenella Vays,Fendi Sweater,fendi peekaboo bag,The pieces are classic and withstand time. They are about quality and not just what is trendy at the moment.

Ghazaleh Matian,Prada Skirt and Prada Sweater(im wearing it),Bottega Veneta Bag (ice cream color),"A luxury fashion brand is something that lasts because it is made with great quality materials.They last generations and I hope to pass all of my luxury items to my offspring one day. The quality honestly speaks for itself. I have a Chanel bag that was handed down to me from my great aunt and it is still my favorite piece. Luxury brands cannot be afforded by all because they are exclusive and that exclusivity makes them even more desired and sought after. There is a reason people wait months to years for their item of their dreams, it is because those items make people not only look great but they also feel great. I love how I feel when i have a new luxury piece to add to my collection."
Hanne Yoon,Gucci Sweater,Chanel Classic Handbag,"I always find classic pieces that I can wear year after year. I'm not the biggest fan of fast trends, so I like investing in classic pieces that I'll have for a long time (due to quality) and because they'll never go out of style. I also love how each luxury fashion brand is so unique and distinct in their own brand - for example with Chanel, you can immediately recognize the brand, whether it be clothings, handbags, shoes, accessories, and even makeup!"

In terms of price, a luxury brand is not affordable and should not be considered attainable- I find that bags and shoes are usually the luxury items people save up for, while luxury clothing is worn only by those who own many luxury pieces.

Luxury brands hand make their items with higher quality, there fore pieces are more limited, which makes it more expensive, and more exclusive."

Michelle Santacoloma,Balenciaga Logo Sweater,,"Investing in luxury fashion means you're investing in longevity for your pieces, quality, and being able to be trendy without actually being trendy - the pieces are different, but always have a classic touch. That's what plays into the longevity."
Molly Penney,Burberry Jacket,Chanel flap bag and Manolo Heels.,A certain price point is definitely a major factor. Anything over $750 seems lux. Also exclusively. I like items that are somewhat hard to get. For example Chanel can’t be purchased online. That makes it more luxury to me. Also many luxury brands only make a limited number of items or for a certain season only. That makes them seem more Lux. I also like to buy things that I see people wearing on reality TV. I’m a major Bravo fan and get a lot of my luxury inspiration from what the housewives wear.
Nakeitheya  Smith,Versace shirt,Chanel bag,"The brand’s story, history and culture is what differentiates a luxury brand."

Renata Garcia,Prada short sleeve button down,"*   YSL Bianca platform heels
    
*   Chanel black caviar medium flap bag","For me personally what differentiates a luxury fashion brand are several factors. First and foremost is quality, the durability of an item is dependent on the quality of the item. I always research the materials the item is made out of not only for my personal knowledge but also to know what I am buying, how to care for it, durability, and if I am getting ripped off. I like to make sure that the luxury item I am paying for is actually luxurious and not cheaply made with cheap materials. I also like to make sure that if I am spending a lot of money I want it to be on something that is timeless and can last for my daughters to one day inherit. Another thing that is important to me is customer service, how you are treated at the store and if they have good service. I also like the items to be exclusive and not something everyone can get their hands on. I also like to buy from brands that have a fair return policy in case I don’t end up liking the item. But the biggest thing after quality has to be customer service. It has happened that I go into a store wanting to buy an item but if I am not treated correctly and nicely by the sales associate I will not buy anything. It also is really frustrating to get a sales associate who doesn’t know much about the brand."
Robin Wilkins Toombs,,,Luxury is not something that everyone can attain. A luxury fashion brand should be (or at least feel) exclusive.
Rotem  Yakobi,Over-sized Givenchy Jacket.,Chanel Silver Mini Bag. 2021 collection.,"Designer bags are truly timeless pieces that one can enjoy for the remainder of their life whereas a regular leather bag is bound to go out of style. Saving and spending a few hundred dollars more to buy a designer piece is truly worth every penny. The quality of designer items are almost always better than any regular item. The stitching, fabrics, leather are extremely unique and made to perfection. I love receiving endless compliments on the luxury items I buy, as it is so rewarding! I feel as if I can pass down my luxury bags, clothes, shoes, and accessories to many generations to come! Absolutely live by quality over quantity."

Samantha Fariello,Burberry jacket,Valentino sandals,"I think what differentiates a luxury designer from others is the cost of the item, the quality and craftsmanship, materials used, as well as the demand and exclusivity of the item. Luxery designers are up to date on the latest styles and they have all the accessories that make my ""wants"" ""needs"""

sara javadi,Louis Vuitton,Dior,Differentiates by the packaging of the product that it’s in. The quality. The services they offer in case something happens or were to happen to your item. The experience in store when you go to purchase an item from any fashion designer brand.
Sarah Miicke,Armani dress,Chanel shoes and LV bag,"The quality, service and relationship are the most important factors. Service not just at the time of purchase but also if an issue arises, they stand by their product. For clothing, being able to alter and have the SA help with fit is very helpful. For shoes and bags, there is nothing more important than your relationship with your SA. Having that relationship is only possible in the luxury market."
Sarah Teharni,Balmain Skirt,Gucci Dionysus Mini,"What differentiates luxury brands from other brands is the quality, design and for clothing also the fit. I find that more times than not you get what your pay for. With luxury brands some items also hold their value and are timeless."

Shannon Smith,Burberry Shirt,Christian Louboutin,In my opinion I am positive that quality differentiates a luxury fashion brand from other fashion brands. Luxury brands create their products with the highest grade of material. I have had other lower end brands that have lasted 6 months while my more luxury items have lasted for years.
Shayda Yamini,,,The material is the biggest difference. You can tell based on the stitching how well made something is everything luxury lasts longer
Shayna Mickle,Saint Laurent Tee,"Saint Laurent Booties

Celine fold bag","in my opinion the things that primarily differentiates luxury fashion brands are listed below:

*   The Exclusivity of the pieces. Typically a designer will create seasonal pieces ( designs, colors, etc) that they will retire at the end of the season. Therefore it creates a sense of urgency for you to buy and uniqueness.
    
*   QUALITY, QUALITY!! The high quality of luxury brands are worth the investment. It’s so comforting to know that your leathered items are made with premium quality and carefully stitched, which in turn would lasts for years for proper care."

Tiesha LeShore,Celine Coat,Fendi Combat,"When you invest in a luxury item, its serves as a unique piece that celebrates your personal style. I keep all of my luxury items, forever."
Whitney Courter,Burberry jacket,YSL camera bag,Quality and exclusivity is what differentiates a luxury fashion brand from other fashion brands. Luxury brands are made from fine materials and hold up well over time. They are a true investment and hold their value. Luxury items are exclusive- not everyone can have them. They are prestigious and valuable.
Yael Elias,Dolce and Gabana Dress,Bottega Veneta Bag,"For one, the price. Second, designer pieces are like collector's item and are usually timeless. The pieces usually retain their value and make you feel as if you belong to a special club"
Yassaman Erfani,"Balmain
",YSL,"A luxury fashion brand is more exclusive than a regular fashion brand. Typically, these brands are setting the standards for current trends rather than following them. The quality of these products (such as that of the fabrics used) is much higher than those of a regular fashion brand, and said products are valued higher cost due to their uniqueness and creative design. Many of the styles implemented by luxury fashion brands are timeless and are fashionable throughout many generations due to their prestige."

Chanel handbag","I would define a luxury brand as a brand that makes products that are rare, unique, high quality and fashion forward. It’s expensive but doesn’t cost more than what it’s worth. They’re hard to find and access. A luxury brand should make you feel luxurious. They produce items you desire not items that you actually require. They make items you desire and will go to great lengths to find pieces you adore."
