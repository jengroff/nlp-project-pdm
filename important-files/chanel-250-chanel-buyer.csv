1,32,Anchorage,White,Under 40,A certain price point is definitely a major factor. Anything over $750 seems lux. Also exclusively. I like items that are somewhat hard to get. For example Chanel can‚Äôt be purchased online. That makes it more luxury to me. Also many luxury brands only make a limited number of items or for a certain season only. That makes them seem more Lux. I also like to buy things that I see people wearing on reality TV. I‚Äôm a major Bravo fan and get a lot of my luxury inspiration from what the housewives wear.

1,31,Austin,White,Under 40,"To me, a luxury brand is brand that has withstand the test of time and is iconic. Iconic in the sense that when you look at a piece of item, you can easily identify the brand. Some great examples of that would be the Chanel classic flap, Louboutins red sole, the Lonchamp tote, and Mulberry bayswater. The second important factor for me is quality. It has to be made to last and the item must have flawless craftsmanship. These are the two things that are important to me when it comes to luxury brands."
1,32,Baltimore,White,Under 40,"The quality, service and relationship are the most important factors. Service not just at the time of purchase but also if an issue arises, they stand by their product. For clothing, being able to alter and have the SA help with fit is very helpful. For shoes and bags, there is nothing more important than your relationship with your SA. Having that relationship is only possible in the luxury market."

1,38,Chicago,White,Under 40,Impeccable quality and style that lasts forever
1,33,Chicago,White,Under 40,I really appreciate the high quality and care that is put into luxury fashion brands. Even the luxe packaging is something that stands out to me from other fashion brands. I also appreciate the value of luxury items and the legacy they leave behind for future generations.
1,36,Chicago,White,Under 40,"Quality is far superior, styles are timeless, part of capsule wardrobe, history of brand / certain styles are both interesting and show how they will continue to stand the test of time."
1,44,Chicago,Asian,40-60,"Quality/craftsmanship, fit, aesthetic"
1,49,Chicago,African American,40-60,My experience has been the quality is better and the styles are classic/timeless which works well for my style. I tend to buy clothes that aren‚Äôt trendy and shoes that tend to be the ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù factor. I also like the exclusivity of buying from luxury brands. Not everyone owns what I have.
1,52,Dallas,Asian,40-60,"Quality, branding, accessibility."
1,40,Denver,White,40-60,"IMO the 3 major fashion conglomerates that produce 90% of the Luxury market share factories. They buy product product in China and assemble in Italy therefor being able to say the item was made in Italy. Kering, LVMH, Richemont.

Hermes and Chanel are still independent which shows in its quality and value retention.

When I buy a Birkin it‚Äôs going to keep, if not double or triple in value. When I buy a YSL Tote I‚Äôm losing my money and the item will soon be out of style.

Same with Chanel Classics. The price may be INSANE but the item will last for years and so will the style. I cannot say the same for Chloe, Givenchy, Gucci or Dolce and Gabbana Bags."
1,35,Honolulu,Asian,Under 40,"Luxury has great quality, timelessness, and amazing long lasting client relationship. I can have rtw sent to my home to try and pay for what I keep. I can reserve items from runway, I can rely on craftsmanship and good tailoring and alterations. Also, items stand the test of wear and time. They look great years later with good maintenance. It‚Äôs worth the investment."
1,35,Honolulu,Asian,Under 40,"What differentiates luxury fashion houses from other fashion brands is of course quality, craftsmanship, after care services and I consider them long term investments. I also have good relationships with my SAs letting me know if something I might want arrived in their boutiques and reserving items for me until I can physically go."
1,43,Houston,Asian,40-60,"Luxury brand usually has more details. Also seasonal designs which are unique. Chanel has their fantasy tweed which is a really beautiful handwork piece. Dior likes their feminine soluette with the waist altered smaller and Dior‚Äôs knit work and crochet handwork are gorgeous.
Chanel and Herm√®s handbags last a long time! The stitching is tight and don‚Äôt come lose. Leather doesn‚Äôt peel."
1,25,Houston,White,Under 40,"For me personally what differentiates a luxury fashion brand are several factors. First and foremost is quality, the durability of an item is dependent on the quality of the item. I always research the materials the item is made out of not only for my personal knowledge but also to know what I am buying, how to care for it, durability, and if I am getting ripped off. I like to make sure that the luxury item I am paying for is actually luxurious and not cheaply made with cheap materials. I also like to make sure that if I am spending a lot of money I want it to be on something that is timeless and can last for my daughters to one day inherit. Another thing that is important to me is customer service, how you are treated at the store and if they have good service. I also like the items to be exclusive and not something everyone can get their hands on. I also like to buy from brands that have a fair return policy in case I don‚Äôt end up liking the item. But the biggest thing after quality has to be customer service. It has happened that I go into a store wanting to buy an item but if I am not treated correctly and nicely by the sales associate I will not buy anything. It also is really frustrating to get a sales associate who doesn‚Äôt know much about the brand."
1,47,Houston,White,40-60,"For me, luxury items are expensive, limited quantities, and items I see in Vogue, editorials, or celebrities"
1,29,Las Vegas,White,Under 40,"Price and exclusivity, knowing that not everyone will be able to buy it. Also that pieces are limited so even if you have money to buy it it‚Äôs not available. What makes Herm√®s so appealing to me is that even of you have the money to buy it doesn‚Äôt mean you will get it. That‚Äôs true luxury to me."
1,32,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"The biggest difference between luxury brands and non luxury brands are that I believe luxury brands make statements, and the quality will most likely last you a life time compared to a non luxury item. I also love the idea of many luxury items being more exclusive and not loosing there values."
1,47,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"It is a statement for a women . After getting married you want to stand up and by having luxury brand show that you are successful and follow trend . Some designers like Chanel is investment , it doesn‚Äôt loose the value .

Luxury brand usually is made of fine and durable quality .

1,29,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"The experience of locating the merchandise and representation of getting it, the quality of the item for the cost as well as longevity of having it and/passing it down"
1,42,Los Angeles,Asian,40-60,I think the main difference is the unique designs that you get from Luxury fashion houses as well as the quality. I still use my Chanel jumbo from 15 years ago for instance.
1,44,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"Exclusivity, quality and craftsmanship. The history and prestige of the brand. A luxury brand will offer a consumer a unique and impeccable shopping experience. ¬†Being able to build relationships with my SA‚Äôs throughout the different luxury brands that I shop at is something I don‚Äôt get with other brands"
1,36,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"in my opinion, luxury fashion brands tend to stay as classics and last much longer than other brands. Also, the quality of fabric and material used in luxury fashion brands have a different feel than of others."
1,32,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,Value in the brand. Luxury items are something that hold their value really well. We‚Äôve seen this with a lot of styles resurfacing (ie Prada re-edition and dior saddle are both bags I had in high school and now I‚Äôm in my 30s and they‚Äôre back in style). The quality is long lasting and something I would hope to pass on to my daughters one day. Luxury items are classics and never go out of style like trendy items and they carry sentimental value. For instance I have a silk Oscar de la renta scarf my mom passed down to me. One day I hope she will also let go of her lady dior bag!
1,43,Los Angeles,Asian,40-60,"I view certain designer brands as timeless and an ‚Äúasset‚Äù for my wardrobe. I think about how I want to wear each piece for 5-10 years, and how good I feel wearing it even if the cost per wear is high. Other fashion brands come and go for me, and I don‚Äôt expect to wear them for more than a season or two. In the last 5 years, I have tried really hard not to buy other brands and only use it to fill a void which designer brands don‚Äôt have such as a plain white T or denim or a passing trend."
1,36,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,Luxury fashion brands are timeless and classic. Will always be in style. They have better quality.
1,47,Los Angeles,Asian,40-60,"Quality, unique design, history and mystique of the fashion house
Seeing famous or beautiful people on IG wear the outfits
Knowing the company supports charitable causes"
1,30,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"The difference between a luxury brand from other fashion houses is quality, exclusivity, price, availability, and the way it is produced. Quality being the most important, as other brands use cheaper materials and mass produce their items by machine, which make available to anyone and everyone, losing its value. Luxury brands hand make their items with higher quality, there fore pieces are more limited, which makes it more expensive, and more exclusive."
1,35,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"The material, fabric, design, cut."
1,34,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,I believe luxury brand is always in style and definitely holds its value
1,55,Los Angeles,Asian,40-60,"Design: each luxury fashion brand has timeless design. Chanel: four pocket design jacket, quilted bag, chain, camellia

Gucci: 3 colors tape,

Christian Dior: forget me nuts, the silhouette(high small waist)

Fendi: two color (beige and black), stripe, beautiful fur collection

Quality is high! you see the excellent craftsmanship. Their pieces are masterpieces:

Chanel: tweed is leakage, details of thread and material is very selected, fashion Jewelly is also very well created

Fendi: their fur collection or fur trimmed coat are outstanding looks and color is amazing

Their monster collection becomes hip and cool for the men

So we know there is a value for the each of merchandise.

It almost feel like an investment.

On the other hands, the other ordinary brands are just consumable."
1,43,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"I prefer luxury fashion more than fashion brands because1. Quality 2. Exclusive, limited edition items 3. Holds resale value, like Hermes bags 4. After sales purchase"
1,37,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"A luxury brand is unique, iconic, and definitely distinguishing from other brands. Whenever I put on a designer item, whether its clothing, shoes, or one of my purses, I feel like a million dollars! The fact that its exclusive is everything to me. When an item is easily accessible to everyone, I feel like it diminishes the value of it. I enjoy buying designer products for this reason... I feel like I work hard, and I want to enjoy the things I buy!!"
1,31,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"Luxury fashion brands are not even comparable to other fashion brands. There is something about the way you feel when wearing nice clothing that has a name to it. In fact, it almost becomes an addiction to buy these items ! I love the way I look and feel when wearing designer, for that reason the elegance and class is what differentiates a luxury fashion brand from others."
1,31,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,The quality Of luxury fashion brands is much better and lasts a lifetime. The pieces can be worn over and over again and still maintain its condition. There is also prestige that is associated with a luxury fashion brands and it makes me feel good while I wear it
1,32,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"Chanel espadrilles
Designer fashion brands provide a sense of style that is timeless and classic. You can style them up and down and a pair well with basic clothing because they are the piece that stands out. The quality is great and you know that it will last forever Designer fashion brands provide a sense of style that is timeless and classic. You can style them up and down and they pair well with basic clothing because they are the piece that stands out. The quality is great and you know that it will last forever"
1,24,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"Designer bags are truly timeless pieces that one can enjoy for the remainder of their life whereas a regular leather bag is bound to go out of style. Saving and spending a few hundred dollars more to buy a designer piece is truly worth every penny. The quality of designer items are almost always better than any regular item. The stitching, fabrics, leather are extremely unique and made to perfection. I love receiving endless compliments on the luxury items I buy, as it is so rewarding! I feel as if I can pass down my luxury bags, clothes, shoes, and accessories to many generations to come! Absolutely live by quality over quantity."
1,34,Los Angeles,Middle Eastern,Under 40,"Fabric, metal color, hardware, quality overall and design"
1,43,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"Luxury brands are better quality, better materials, the material used are more durable, long lasting, their design is unique."
1,37,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"Quality, stitching, exclusivity, reputation, social status"
1,34,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"I would define a luxury brand as a brand that makes products that are rare, unique, high quality and fashion forward. It‚Äôs expensive but doesn‚Äôt cost more than what it‚Äôs worth. They‚Äôre hard to find and access. A luxury brand should make you feel luxurious. They produce items you desire not items that you actually require. They make items you desire and will go to great lengths to find pieces you adore."
1,31,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"To me it all comes down to durability. What I love about luxury brands are the craftsmanship, work, and detail that goes into every item assuring that I can use this item for years to come. I love that!"
1,54,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"Exclusivity - the item I buy won't be easy to find or for others to find. Quality - the construction will be the finest and made to last a long time. Taste - the item will be one that will be in good taste even if it is avant garde or not yet in fashion. Uniqueness - the item will reflect a certain style or aesthetic that the particular brand is known for and will be in character with the identity of the brand. Splurge - the item will be more expensive than other items and will add a feeling of luxe that will elevate any outfit. Overall brand identity - the brand will carefully curate its messaging so that I will feel proud to be associated with the brand and those that wear it.
Inventiveness - the brand will seek to explore new ideas and styles, and to set the trends years in advance, and will not be content to simply follow the mainstream. Design - the item will be designed to feature thoughtful details and features that are unique and will be useful to or delight the wearer. Experience - the experience of purchasing the item will be a pleasure from start to finish, from stepping into the store, whether to browse or ultimately purchase. There is a feeling that the brand seeks to build a lasting relationship to which the buyer wants to return again and again, not a short term sales transaction."
1,33,Miami,White,Under 40,"Quality, exclusivity and timelessness"
1,52,Miami,White,40-60,"There is a reason why there is a cache attached to Luxury fashion--it's fit, quality and structure I find to be far superior. Also these brands retain their value. Almost like a commodity on the stock exchange. That is the selling point I should tell my husband ü§£. I also love that when you purchase a luxury clothing item not everyone is wearing it--I like to have my own kind of style and enjoy wearing pieces that are not as easy to come by. Designers aren't mass producing these items. And they are made more personally. Stitching by hand, almost like it's made just for me. If that makes sense."
1,49,Miami,White,40-60,"The unique touches such as the type and placement of hardware or a design/pattern indicating within which season it was purchased. Also the timeless of Chanel, the versatility of Louis Vuitton & the trendiness of Gucci. Each luxury brand has a touch that differentiates it from another brand."
1,47,Miami,White,40-60,"I think you really can tell the difference in quality by touching, looking at stitching , weight and look of it says it all. The details that takes a longer time to get done. No comparison at all to cheap brands.
It takes a lot of craft-man ship to get this done."
1,61,Miami,White,40-60,"Exclusivity, quality, and cutting edge fashion"
1,29,Miami,White,Under 40,Luxury fashion brands are quality pieces that don‚Äôt lose value. They last a lifetime if cared for properly. I love classic styles that never go out of style as well as unique pieces. I love following current fashion trends.
1,29,Miami,Asian,Under 40,"I always find classic pieces that I can wear year after year. I'm not the biggest fan of fast trends, so I like investing in classic pieces that I'll have for a long time (due to quality) and because they'll never go out of style. I also love how each luxury fashion brand is so unique and distinct in their own brand - for example with Chanel, you can immediately recognize the brand, whether it be clothings, handbags, shoes, accessories, and even makeup!"

1,37,New York,White,Under 40,Luxury is not something that everyone can attain. A luxury fashion brand should be (or at least feel) exclusive.
1,27,New York,White,Under 40,"Price, quality, reputation"
1,57,New York,White,40-60,"The luxury designer clothing,shoes,bags quality is for lifetime and always look classy and in style"
1,30,New York,White,Under 40,The difference in exclusivity and quality. Luxury fashion allows me to find items that most people my age can‚Äôt.
1,60,New York,White,40-60,A luxury brand is more timeless than a run of the mill brand with better materials and overall quality. The pieces are well constructed and last for years. A lot of luxury items tend to have logos so that fashionistas can show off but I am much more about the quality and want subtle logos on my luxury items.
1,49,New York,White,40-60,"The details make the difference to me. Soft satin lining a jacket, a zipper that moves smoothly, stitching that doesn‚Äôt come loose....."
1,32,New York,White,Under 40,The exclusivity of luxury brands is everything. Because some luxury items are hard to get and find easily in stores is why I want them. It‚Äôs different from fashion brands that available everywhere.
1,59,New York,White,40-60,I think the quality of many of the designer items I have is better than some of my other garments. The expensive pieces that I buy look good for years. I only buy classic pieces so my things are timeless. I still where a chanel bag that I got 30 years ago. I treat my designer things well and I'm very careful with them. I also buy these things because I admit to liking the status and wearing these things makes me feel a bit more special and can give me a lift.
1,60,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury brand is an evolving art. It represents centuries of traditions, incredible craftsmanship, timeless, undeniably recognizable classic and unique collectors/museum pieces. The fashion houses of Herm√®s, Chanel, Dior, etc endeavor to create a catered buying experience. I value a special connection with a Luxury Boutique Management, SAs, Alterations and Post Sale services. It seems a luxury brand appreciates not only my purchasing power but loyalty and knowledge of collections."
1,24,New York,White,Under 40,"A luxury fashion brand is defined by its price point, its client base, and its history. To me, a luxury fashion brand has been around for a while. In terms of price, a luxury brand is not affordable and should not be considered attainable- I find that bags and shoes are usually the luxury items people save up for, while luxury clothing is worn only by those who own many luxury pieces. I think luxury brands are ones that few people are wearing- that's what makes them special!!"
1,25,New York,White,Under 40,"I believe it is the quality of fabric, the tailoring and the attention to detail in each item."
1,42,New York,White,40-60,"Quality, craftsmanship and longevity, timeless"
1,43,New York,White,40-60,"The high quality, craftsmanship and uncompromised style. There‚Äôs nothing like the feeling you get from buying a luxury piece and every time you wear it - so much joy."
1,45,New York,Asian,40-60,"Every high end luxury item purchased, whether clothing, shoes, bags, or jewelry are of exceptional quality and worth the cost. They are timeless and therefore serve as heirlooms that I look forward to handing down to my daughter."
1,57,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury brand is a brand that is special and set apart by its quality and, therefore, price."
1,40,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury brand is all about the experience you have in store or virtually. The caliber of sales associates, the story/history behind the brand and the quality of the goods. Attention to detail in store, virtually, if/how the SA follows up or does outreach, how you feel when engaging with the brand or wearing pieces from it."
1,41,New York,African American,40-60,The fact that it‚Äôs exclusive and mostly harder to get due to it‚Äôs usually higher price points. There is also much more attention to detail and better craftsmanship secondary to the fact that it‚Äôs usually handmade as opposed to mass produced.
1,37,New York,White,Under 40,"To me it‚Äôs about a few things. One is exclusivity, the harder an item is to get the more luxurious it seems to feel. A luxury brand always feels different craftsmanship wise & more special. The leather is always softer, the detailing perfect, nothing like it. It also makes you feel more confident when you wear it."
1,58,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury fashion brand uses the highest quality material, expert workmanship and you can see this in the details of the finished product . In addition there is a timelessness to the styling that is unmistakable."
1,30,New York,White,Under 40,Quality and timelessness
1,35,New York ,White,Under 40,"I think what differentiates a luxury fashion brand from other fashion brands is quality of materials and construction, level of customer service"
1,40,New York ,White,40-60,"In my opinion, a luxury fashion brand has a certain signature presence, as well as superior quality/craftsmanship"
1,48,New York ,African American,40-60,"I like the construction and the timelessness of luxury pieces. They stand the test of time and become heirlooms. They are always prized for status as well.
I like having something different than the masses."
1,50,New York ,White,40-60,"When you purchase a luxury fashion brand, you know that you were buying some thing that is well-made, and will most likely stand the test of time (trend wise). I tend to wear mostly luxury brands with timeless looks so I can get the most use out of them, rather than just buying trendy clothing that may not fit me well. Also, with designer apparel, I know the fit will be nicer and showcase my body better than just a less expensive brand."
1,46,Philadelphia,White,40-60,"For me it‚Äôs all about the feel of the fabrics , the aesthetics of the look. The way the fabrics fit really differentiates the brand. As for Handbags I feel that the quality and the design in luxury is unmatched. When it comes to shoes I appreciate comfort but I really love the style of the shoes. Luxury is custom and can‚Äôt be duplicated."
1,45,Philadelphia,White,40-60,"Quality, exclusivity, style"
1,53,Philadelphia,White,40-60,I would say unfortunately the label. It‚Äôs a status symbol for our income level. Clearly myself and others at our income level tend to shop in stores such as Bergdorf‚Äôs and Saks where you can only purchase luxury labels. I really feel social media has fueled people‚Äôs desires to obtain label status even at lower income levels.
1,52,San Diego,White,40-60,"The differentiating qualities of a luxury fashion brand includes source materials, design, quality of construction, service delivery and client relationship building. Luxury fashion sources the best materials to create the product. These materials have a more pleasing feel and look, longevity and wear better than non-luxury brands. The design aspects of luxury stems from the creative minds at the helm of the various fashion brands. Luxury fashion creates the look while non-luxury follows the look. Quality of construction and fit sets apart luxury fashion from the rest. Luxury items are made with care and it shows from the pattern, fit and finish...just doesn't compare. Finally, service delivery and relationship building is at the core of luxury. The presentation of the final product and treatment of clientele creates an experience. Luxury shopping should be an experience of enjoyment and echo the brands' overall image and be relatable to the client."
1,43,San Francisco,White,40-60,Well made. Unique pieces that you won‚Äôt see every day. High end fashion. Good customer service in store. Forever pieces.
1,32,San Francisco,Asian,Under 40,"Quality, craftsmanship and exclusivity all come to mind when I think of luxury goods. I also tend to avoid trendy items so I feel that all the items I buy I will continue to love and enjoy vs a more fast fashion approach which feels both wasteful and fleeting. I also love that the bags and shoes are not only made well, but are worth repairing and can be enjoyed many times over."
1,39,San Francisco,White,40-60,"For me, it's the quality and level of service. Items last a long time and are very well made. The ones I like have a classic feel with long lasting leather and fabric choices. Because of this, luxury items hold their value well too. I also like that they influence other brands, with their shows. I can see elements of luxury designs in a lot of other brands."
1,33,San Francisco,Asian,Under 40,"Classic, beautiful pieces."
1,36,Santa Monica,White,Under 40,The feel of the store when you walk in. Designer stores make you feel special and the quality of the clothes / shoes / handbags makes you feel good.

1,41,Washington D.C.,Asian,40-60,High price point. Long history and tradition of the fashion house. High level of quality and craftsmanship. Exclusivity and not available to the masses.
