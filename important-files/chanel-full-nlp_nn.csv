1,32,Anchorage,White,Under 40,A certain price point is definitely a major factor. Anything over $750 seems lux. Also exclusively. I like items that are somewhat hard to get. For example Chanel can’t be purchased online. That makes it more luxury to me. Also many luxury brands only make a limited number of items or for a certain season only. That makes them seem more Lux. I also like to buy things that I see people wearing on reality TV. I’m a major Bravo fan and get a lot of my luxury inspiration from what the housewives wear.

0,34,Atlanta,White,Under 40,"To me, a luxury fashion brand is lifestyle design through clothing, accessories & often other lifestyle pieces & wares compared with just selling ad how outfit pieces. Often, luxury fashion brands are also higher quality & longer lasting style."
0,36,Atlanta,White,Under 40,"in my opinion the things that primarily differentiates luxury fashion brands are listed below:

*   The Exclusivity of the pieces. Typically a designer will create seasonal pieces ( designs, colors, etc) that they will retire at the end of the season. Therefore it creates a sense of urgency for you to buy and uniqueness.
    
*   QUALITY, QUALITY!! The high quality of luxury brands are worth the investment. It’s so comforting to know that your leathered items are made with premium quality and carefully stitched, which in turn would lasts for years for proper care."
1,31,Austin,White,Under 40,"To me, a luxury brand is brand that has withstand the test of time and is iconic. Iconic in the sense that when you look at a piece of item, you can easily identify the brand. Some great examples of that would be the Chanel classic flap, Louboutins red sole, the Lonchamp tote, and Mulberry bayswater. The second important factor for me is quality. It has to be made to last and the item must have flawless craftsmanship. These are the two things that are important to me when it comes to luxury brands."
1,32,Baltimore,White,Under 40,"The quality, service and relationship are the most important factors. Service not just at the time of purchase but also if an issue arises, they stand by their product. For clothing, being able to alter and have the SA help with fit is very helpful. For shoes and bags, there is nothing more important than your relationship with your SA. Having that relationship is only possible in the luxury market."

You can wear these brands anytime and almost anywhere and their easily recognizable and makes your whole outfit chic! I also love the fact that luxury items now hold much of their value particularly bags like chanel or Hermes. Some are even considered investment pieces . I also love VIP treatment of SA’s and the houses themselves to clients like us. We are often made to feel special and important whenever we shop, answering all our questions and being patient with us, especially during the pandemic when going to the store was not possible. Talking or texting my SA helped a lot! Luxury brands also know how to zhush up their Classic collections based on trends with limited-editions and collabs! It makes you covet more from a particular house all the time!"
0,46,Boston,White,40-60,I love that not everyone has my bags. I love limited editions. The quality and craftsmanship of designer items is what makes me want to buy them.

1,33,Chicago,White,Under 40,I really appreciate the high quality and care that is put into luxury fashion brands. Even the luxe packaging is something that stands out to me from other fashion brands. I also appreciate the value of luxury items and the legacy they leave behind for future generations.

0,34,Chicago,Asian,Under 40,"The main differentiating factor of a luxury fashion brand is the quality of product that you are receiving. Simply touching a designer leather purse, you can feel how soft the high quality material is compared to any other brand. The luxury brands have a well-established reputation of providing superior products and innovative design that other brands can not provide. Every little detail, such as the seamwork of an article of clothing, is executed so perfectly that the items are more durable (if treated appropriately). The luxury brands also offer the individual a sense of status and uniqueness."
0,25,Chicago,White,Under 40,The quality of the item. The clothing/bag/ shoes stays in optimal condition and always looks brand new. They are pieces that I always look forward to wearing and feel confident in.
0,38,Chicago,White,Under 40,"I think it’s definitely exclusivity - the feeling that you’re being offered/buying something that the public doesn’t have ready or easy access to ... for sure.
I think with the big fashion houses, it’s important to build your relationship - as the years go by, you are offered better items more frequently - which helps you feel like you paid off the past — if that makes sense —"
0,47,Chicago,Asian,40-60,The reason I will purchase a luxury fashion brand over other fashion brands is for the quality. Each piece is an investment and I select items that are classic that will not only endure throughout the years (wear and tear) but also will never go out of style.
0,29,Chicago,White,Under 40,"The experience of buying in a luxury store vs. buying from a store that has racks of the same item.

The quality of the items can last a lifetime"
0,45,Chicago,White,40-60,The quality of the design and materials is much higher for designer clothing and accessories than other fashion brands. I prefer to have items that last than items that wear quickly. There is also a resale value to a birkin bag or luxury item versus an non luxury item.
1,49,Chicago,African American,40-60,My experience has been the quality is better and the styles are classic/timeless which works well for my style. I tend to buy clothes that aren’t trendy and shoes that tend to be the “WOW” factor. I also like the exclusivity of buying from luxury brands. Not everyone owns what I have.

0,23,Dallas,White,Under 40,"The brand strategy for luxury brands is different than other fashion brands. Luxury doesn’t meet a need or solve a problem, and so it is intrinsically wrong to position a luxury brand based on how it compares to its competitors. Luxury consumers aren’t interested in more features giving better value for money – that’s a premium marketing angle. Luxury consumers want to know about a brand’s heritage, prestige and uniqueness; it’s identity which counts, rather than a competitive edge."

Hermes and Chanel are still independent which shows in its quality and value retention.

When I buy a Birkin it’s going to keep, if not double or triple in value. When I buy a YSL Tote I’m losing my money and the item will soon be out of style.

Same with Chanel Classics. The price may be INSANE but the item will last for years and so will the style. I cannot say the same for Chloe, Givenchy, Gucci or Dolce and Gabbana Bags."

I can reserve items from runway, I can rely on craftsmanship and good tailoring and alterations. Also, items stand the test of wear and time. They look great years later with good maintenance. It’s worth the investment."
1,35,Honolulu,Asian,Under 40,"What differentiates luxury fashion houses from other fashion brands is of course quality, craftsmanship, after care services and I consider them long term investments. I also have good relationships with my SAs letting me know if something I might want arrived in their boutiques and reserving items for me until I can physically go."
1,43,Houston,Asian,40-60,"Luxury brand usually has more details. Also seasonal designs which are unique. Chanel has their fantasy tweed which is a really beautiful handwork piece. Dior likes their feminine soluette with the waist altered smaller and Dior’s knit work and crochet handwork are gorgeous.
Chanel and Hermès handbags last a long time! The stitching is tight and don’t come lose. Leather doesn’t peel."
1,25,Houston,White,Under 40,"For me personally what differentiates a luxury fashion brand are several factors. First and foremost is quality, the durability of an item is dependent on the quality of the item. I always research the materials the item is made out of not only for my personal knowledge but also to know what I am buying, how to care for it, durability, and if I am getting ripped off. I like to make sure that the luxury item I am paying for is actually luxurious and not cheaply made with cheap materials. I also like to make sure that if I am spending a lot of money I want it to be on something that is timeless and can last for my daughters to one day inherit. Another thing that is important to me is customer service, how you are treated at the store and if they have good service. I also like the items to be exclusive and not something everyone can get their hands on. I also like to buy from brands that have a fair return policy in case I don’t end up liking the item. But the biggest thing after quality has to be customer service. It has happened that I go into a store wanting to buy an item but if I am not treated correctly and nicely by the sales associate I will not buy anything. It also is really frustrating to get a sales associate who doesn’t know much about the brand."
1,47,Houston,White,40-60,"For me, luxury items are expensive, limited quantities, and items I see in Vogue, editorials, or celebrities"

0,33,Houston,Hispanic,Under 40,Luxury brands have an immediate recognizability that you do not get from other fashion brands. They connote a certain amount of style by the wearer and have the added bonus of being durable.
0,42,Houston,White,40-60,"To me, the difference between luxury fashion and regular fashion is the quality and the exclusivity. Luxury items have a longer life because they are made better and designers stand behind their items, so if there is a problem they are more apt to make it right. Fashion is everywhere but luxury isn't and that's why I love it."

A luxury fashion brand have beautiful boutique where you don’t just shop, you get to experience the brand lifestyle. In addition, the items sold by luxury brands are high quality, hard to acquire (price, rarity), and only sold in boutiques. The packaging is beautiful. They take care of their customers and stand behind their products. You don’t get that from non luxury brands."
1,29,Las Vegas,White,Under 40,"Price and exclusivity, knowing that not everyone will be able to buy it. Also that pieces are limited so even if you have money to buy it it’s not available. What makes Hermès so appealing to me is that even of you have the money to buy it doesn’t mean you will get it. That’s true luxury to me."
1,32,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"The biggest difference between luxury brands and non luxury brands are that I believe luxury brands make statements, and the quality will most likely last you a life time compared to a non luxury item. I also love the idea of many luxury items being more exclusive and not loosing there values."

1,32,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,Value in the brand. Luxury items are something that hold their value really well. We’ve seen this with a lot of styles resurfacing (ie Prada re-edition and dior saddle are both bags I had in high school and now I’m in my 30s and they’re back in style). The quality is long lasting and something I would hope to pass on to my daughters one day. Luxury items are classics and never go out of style like trendy items and they carry sentimental value. For instance I have a silk Oscar de la renta scarf my mom passed down to me. One day I hope she will also let go of her lady dior bag!
1,43,Los Angeles,Asian,40-60,"I view certain designer brands as timeless and an “asset” for my wardrobe. I think about how I want to wear each piece for 5-10 years, and how good I feel wearing it even if the cost per wear is high. Other fashion brands come and go for me, and I don’t expect to wear them for more than a season or two. In the last 5 years, I have tried really hard not to buy other brands and only use it to fill a void which designer brands don’t have such as a plain white T or denim or a passing trend."

1,30,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"The difference between a luxury brand from other fashion houses is quality, exclusivity, price, availability, and the way it is produced. Quality being the most important, as other brands use cheaper materials and mass produce their items by machine, which make available to anyone and everyone, losing its value. Luxury brands hand make their items with higher quality, there fore pieces are more limited, which makes it more expensive, and more exclusive."

Fendi: two color (beige and black), stripe, beautiful fur collection

Quality is high! you see the excellent craftsmanship. Their pieces are masterpieces:

Chanel: tweed is leakage, details of thread and material is very selected, fashion Jewelly is also very well created

Fendi: their fur collection or fur trimmed coat are outstanding looks and color is amazing

Their monster collection becomes hip and cool for the men

So even when they sell something casual, like T shirts or even a pair of socks, I would trust them with their quality as well as the design and after-care. Yes, they are more expensive so people might think they’d better be good, and in most cases in my opinion they actually are more than good. They are the top runner of the trend, they have pride and belief in their products and their passion to please and satisfy their clients always impress me and make me want to go back to the same brands."
1,31,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"To me it all comes down to durability. What I love about luxury brands are the craftsmanship, work, and detail that goes into every item assuring that I can use this item for years to come. I love that!"
1,54,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"Exclusivity - the item I buy won't be easy to find or for others to find. Quality - the construction will be the finest and made to last a long time. Taste - the item will be one that will be in good taste even if it is avant garde or not yet in fashion. Uniqueness - the item will reflect a certain style or aesthetic that the particular brand is known for and will be in character with the identity of the brand. Splurge - the item will be more expensive than other items and will add a feeling of luxe that will elevate any outfit. Overall brand identity - the brand will carefully curate its messaging so that I will feel proud to be associated with the brand and those that wear it.
Inventiveness - the brand will seek to explore new ideas and styles, and to set the trends years in advance, and will not be content to simply follow the mainstream. Design - the item will be designed to feature thoughtful details and features that are unique and will be useful to or delight the wearer. Experience - the experience of purchasing the item will be a pleasure from start to finish, from stepping into the store, whether to browse or ultimately purchase. There is a feeling that the brand seeks to build a lasting relationship to which the buyer wants to return again and again, not a short term sales transaction."
0,43,Los Angeles,White,40-60,"Luxury brands focus on the total elevated experience for the customers. The store, ambiance, the staff, every detail that includes elevated shopping bags and gift wrap. The pieces are special not mainstream. Shopping luxury brands creates a “rush” for me. A special gift that I prefer not to see everyone having."
0,36,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,"A luxury fashion brand is something that lasts because it is made with great quality materials.They last generations and I hope to pass all of my luxury items to my offspring one day. The quality honestly speaks for itself. I have a Chanel bag that was handed down to me from my great aunt and it is still my favorite piece. Luxury brands cannot be afforded by all because they are exclusive and that exclusivity makes them even more desired and sought after. There is a reason people wait months to years for their item of their dreams, it is because those items make people not only look great but they also feel great. I love how I feel when i have a new luxury piece to add to my collection."
0,27,Los Angeles,White,Under 40,When I think of luxury I think of high quality. You know it will last. It also makes you feel expensive and confident when wearing luxury.

0,45,Miami,White,40-60,Quality over quantity. Style offered. Timeless pieces.
1,52,Miami,White,40-60,"There is a reason why there is a cache attached to Luxury fashion--it's fit, quality and structure I find to be far superior. Also these brands retain their value. Almost like a commodity on the stock exchange. That is the selling point I should tell my husband 🤣. I also love that when you purchase a luxury clothing item not everyone is wearing it--I like to have my own kind of style and enjoy wearing pieces that are not as easy to come by. Designers aren't mass producing these items. And they are made more personally. Stitching by hand, almost like it's made just for me. If that makes sense."
1,49,Miami,White,40-60,"The unique touches such as the type and placement of hardware or a design/pattern indicating within which season it was purchased. Also the timeless of Chanel, the versatility of Louis Vuitton & the trendiness of Gucci. Each luxury brand has a touch that differentiates it from another brand."
0,27,Miami,White,Under 40,"In my opinion, a luxury handbag, shoes, or jacket completes an outfit. It makes you stand out in a crowd."
1,47,Miami,White,40-60,"I think you really can tell the difference in quality by touching, looking at stitching , weight and look of it says it all. The details that takes a longer time to get done. No comparison at all to cheap brands.
It takes a lot of craft-man ship to get this done."
0,56,Miami,White,40-60,Luxury items are life long items. I have started my collection of designer items since my Asians and I still wear items that are 30+ years old. Old styles always come back! I love my luxury items!

1,29,Miami,Asian,Under 40,"I always find classic pieces that I can wear year after year. I'm not the biggest fan of fast trends, so I like investing in classic pieces that I'll have for a long time (due to quality) and because they'll never go out of style. I also love how each luxury fashion brand is so unique and distinct in their own brand - for example with Chanel, you can immediately recognize the brand, whether it be clothings, handbags, shoes, accessories, and even makeup!"

0,25,Miami,White,Under 40,A luxury fashion brand piece stands out and makes an outfit. A luxury designer also has pieces that last you and the quality of the item lasts a lot longer than a typical item.
0,29,Miami,White,Under 40,Chicness of the runway shows
0,32,Miami,White,Under 40,In my opinion I am positive that quality differentiates a luxury fashion brand from other fashion brands. Luxury brands create their products with the highest grade of material. I have had other lower end brands that have lasted 6 months while my more luxury items have lasted for years.
0,51,Miami,White,40-60,I just love the quality of the products as well as the classic styles. I have new trendy pieces as well as classics that I’ve held into for years that still look brand new.

0,39,Miami,White,Under 40,"I think what differentiates a luxury designer from others is the cost of the item, the quality and craftsmanship, materials used, as well as the demand and exclusivity of the item. Luxery designers are up to date on the latest styles and they have all the accessories that make my ""wants"" ""needs"""
0,33,New Orleans,White,Under 40,"I think it's the overall experience that you get when you purchase designer clothes - from champagne in the store, one on one shopping, sales assistants that want to help you, just an overall really pleasant experience! Makes me feel great :-)"
0,31,New Orleans,White,Under 40,"History of brand, including where the brand originated and how old it is. Name recognition is also important. The brand must be known for quality materials and classic yet unique designs, and designs that withstand the test of time."
1,37,New York,White,Under 40,Luxury is not something that everyone can attain. A luxury fashion brand should be (or at least feel) exclusive.
0,42,New York,White,40-60,"I feel good investing in a luxury brand items because they have better quality, ie better and longer use time, as opposed to brands that aren’t as high quality. Also, the styles I tend to gravitate to are more timeless and I’m able to enjoy season after season."
0,60,New York,White,40-60,"Details differentiate a luxury fashion brand from other fashion brands.

For example: How seams are finished inside the garment.

Materials used for hardware.

Something about the luxury item should not be replicable. 

The brand and it's products must be Top of class and deliver some meaningful or measurable value like Innovation, Exclusivity, Heritage, Relevance."

1,57,New York,White,40-60,"The luxury designer clothing,shoes,bags quality is for lifetime and always look classy and in style"
1,30,New York,White,Under 40,The difference in exclusivity and quality. Luxury fashion allows me to find items that most people my age can’t.
1,60,New York,White,40-60,A luxury brand is more timeless than a run of the mill brand with better materials and overall quality. The pieces are well constructed and last for years. A lot of luxury items tend to have logos so that fashionistas can show off but I am much more about the quality and want subtle logos on my luxury items.
1,49,New York,White,40-60,"The details make the difference to me. Soft satin lining a jacket, a zipper that moves smoothly, stitching that doesn’t come loose....."
1,32,New York,White,Under 40,The exclusivity of luxury brands is everything. Because some luxury items are hard to get and find easily in stores is why I want them. It’s different from fashion brands that available everywhere.
1,59,New York,White,40-60,I think the quality of many of the designer items I have is better than some of my other garments. The expensive pieces that I buy look good for years. I only buy classic pieces so my things are timeless. I still where a chanel bag that I got 30 years ago. I treat my designer things well and I'm very careful with them. I also buy these things because I admit to liking the status and wearing these things makes me feel a bit more special and can give me a lift.
1,60,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury brand is an evolving art. It represents centuries of traditions, incredible craftsmanship, timeless, undeniably recognizable classic and unique collectors/museum pieces. The fashion houses of Hermès, Chanel, Dior, etc endeavor to create a catered buying experience. I value a special connection with a Luxury Boutique Management, SAs, Alterations and Post Sale services. It seems a luxury brand appreciates not only my purchasing power but loyalty and knowledge of collections."
1,24,New York,White,Under 40,"A luxury fashion brand is defined by its price point, its client base, and its history. To me, a luxury fashion brand has been around for a while. In terms of price, a luxury brand is not affordable and should not be considered attainable- I find that bags and shoes are usually the luxury items people save up for, while luxury clothing is worn only by those who own many luxury pieces. I think luxury brands are ones that few people are wearing- that's what makes them special!!"
1,25,New York,White,Under 40,"I believe it is the quality of fabric, the tailoring and the attention to detail in each item."

1,45,New York,Asian,40-60,"Every high end luxury item purchased, whether clothing, shoes, bags, or jewelry are of exceptional quality and worth the cost. They are timeless and therefore serve as heirlooms that I look forward to handing down to my daughter."
1,57,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury brand is a brand that is special and set apart by its quality and, therefore, price."
1,40,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury brand is all about the experience you have in store or virtually. The caliber of sales associates, the story/history behind the brand and the quality of the goods. Attention to detail in store, virtually, if/how the SA follows up or does outreach, how you feel when engaging with the brand or wearing pieces from it."
0,34,New York,White,Under 40,"A luxury brand is about craftsmanship, exclusivity, a feeling of belonging to a club that not everyone can belong to. When you wear them, you’re treated with respect and when you shop for them, you’re treated to an experience. Sales Associates know you by name and know what you like. You see others carrying the same brand and it is like they are in the know. You do not get that feeling with regular brands."
0,29,New York,White,Under 40,The quality of the pieces is much better than other fashion brands and the styles are more unique.

0,28,New York,White,Under 40,A long and rich heritage combined with exquisite craftsmanship using skilled artisans. The aura and illusion of exclusivity as well.
0,58,New York,White,40-60,"The attention to detail, the superior craftsmanship, the higher quality and uniqueness of the materials, be it fabrics, leathers or metals, the originality of the designs, the limited supply."
0,33,New York,Asian,Under 40,"The most important quality that differentiates a fashion brand is the overall feel of the brand. What style or image are they trying to portray through the combined collection of bags, clothes, shoes, etc? That’s an important question. I also think having an original and unique style also is important. For example, I’ve seen a few brands copy Hermès Kelly or Chanel classic flap and it makes me feel like this brand that copies others hasn’t really matured yet. Finally, I consider investment value. I’m always updating my closet and my style has changed from my Asians to early 30s. I never buy with the intention to sell, but I am conscious that my style might be in the middle of changing so I keep abreast of how easily the bag sells and whether or not it can hold its value.
Recently I’ve noticed handbag quality of brands like Chanel and Hermès have been inconsistent. It’s made me reconsider paying a premium. If I want a green bag, I may just buy a different brand. I find dior and fendi to be “edgier” now"
0,44,New York,Asian,40-60,Luxury fashion brand stands for exquisite quality and high standards.

I like having a style that reflects my personal lifestyle, and also having items coveted by others."
0,32,New York,White,Under 40,For me it’s whether the collections are timeless and will hold their allure beyond one season. Ie a Chanel tweed blazer
0,26,New York,White,Under 40,"A luxury fashion brand is differentiated from other fashion brands by the craftsmanship and quality of materials used to create their garments and accessories. Purchasing something from a luxury brand is an investment in a quality piece that will stand the test of time rather than something expendable. The experience of purchasing an item from a luxury brand is special, especially in a standalone boutique, as you are often offered the history or idea behind a piece you are considering purchasing."

0,27,New York,White,Under 40,The differentiator is by far the quality and the material. Luxury goods are noticeably better quality just by the look and feel and how it holds up and holds its value over time.
0,44,New York,Asian,40-60,Quality of the materials and the construction. I like the idea of “investment” pieces.
0,41,New York,White,40-60,"I find that luxury brands fabric and the way it fits and feels there is a very big difference between a high end brand and other fashion brands. It just forms to the body differently and feels better on a women’s body. I truly believe that spending a bit more money is worth it due to longevity as well. Price is what you pay , value is what you get !"
0,31,New York,White,Under 40,"Luxury fashion brands differ in terms of quality and craftsmanship, personalised service, limited pieces, and history of the individual luxury fashion houses eg Chanel or Hermes.

0,44,New York,White,40-60,A luxury fashion brand offers a quality and style above and beyond what you will find at a “typical” retailer. The designers at prestigious fashion houses are creating pieces of art so when I add to my collection it is more than just a garment or accessory.

1,41,New York,African American,40-60,The fact that it’s exclusive and mostly harder to get due to it’s usually higher price points. There is also much more attention to detail and better craftsmanship secondary to the fact that it’s usually handmade as opposed to mass produced.
0,43,New York,White,40-60,"High quality, exclusiveness, prestige, accumulated value over time"
1,37,New York,White,Under 40,"To me it’s about a few things. One is exclusivity, the harder an item is to get the more luxurious it seems to feel. A luxury brand always feels different craftsmanship wise & more special. The leather is always softer, the detailing perfect, nothing like it. It also makes you feel more confident when you wear it."
1,58,New York,White,40-60,"A luxury fashion brand uses the highest quality material, expert workmanship and you can see this in the details of the finished product . In addition there is a timelessness to the styling that is unmistakable."

Luxury is custom and can’t be duplicated."
1,45,Philadelphia,White,40-60,"Quality, exclusivity, style"
1,53,Philadelphia,White,40-60,I would say unfortunately the label. It’s a status symbol for our income level. Clearly myself and others at our income level tend to shop in stores such as Bergdorf’s and Saks where you can only purchase luxury labels. I really feel social media has fueled people’s desires to obtain label status even at lower income levels.
0,47,Philadelphia,White,40-60,I feel like a luxury brand can change the entire dynamics of any outfit. You could wear a sweatshirt and leggings from target but If you have a Chanel bag or a luxury brand it automatically changes the entire vibe of your style and or outfit.

0,42,Sacramento,White,40-60,"The quality and craftsmanship. Details in each piece is what makes it special. Customer service also counts, down to packaging.
Since the pandemic started I just buy online and over the phone with a Sales Associate and they alway ship my items first class."
1,52,San Diego,White,40-60,"The differentiating qualities of a luxury fashion brand includes source materials, design, quality of construction, service delivery and client relationship building. Luxury fashion sources the best materials to create the product. These materials have a more pleasing feel and look, longevity and wear better than non-luxury brands. The design aspects of luxury stems from the creative minds at the helm of the various fashion brands. Luxury fashion creates the look while non-luxury follows the look. Quality of construction and fit sets apart luxury fashion from the rest. Luxury items are made with care and it shows from the pattern, fit and finish...just doesn't compare. Finally, service delivery and relationship building is at the core of luxury. The presentation of the final product and treatment of clientele creates an experience. Luxury shopping should be an experience of enjoyment and echo the brands' overall image and be relatable to the client."

0,52,San Francisco,Asian,40-60,Timeless and ageless styles are the main reason I shop for the luxury fashion brands. For example I feel always so proud and happy to carry my Asian+years handbags from Hermès ( Kelly 35 sellier to be specific). Hermès also releases some new styles of handbags but they usually variate in sizes ( minis are very hot now). I used to love Louis Vuitton but as they explore too many styles in printing ( monogram with some designs) I began to avoid such items as I feel carrying them is outdated.
1,43,San Francisco,White,40-60,Well made. Unique pieces that you won’t see every day. High end fashion. Good customer service in store. Forever pieces.
1,32,San Francisco,Asian,Under 40,"Quality, craftsmanship and exclusivity all come to mind when I think of luxury goods. I also tend to avoid trendy items so I feel that all the items I buy I will continue to love and enjoy vs a more fast fashion approach which feels both wasteful and fleeting. I also love that the bags and shoes are not only made well, but are worth repairing and can be enjoyed many times over."
1,39,San Francisco,White,40-60,"For me, it's the quality and level of service. Items last a long time and are very well made. The ones I like have a classic feel with long lasting leather and fabric choices. Because of this, luxury items hold their value well too. I also like that they influence other brands, with their shows. I can see elements of luxury designs in a lot of other brands."
0,37,San Francisco,Asian,Under 40,"Original and distinctive design. Quality in the craftsmanship, made with fine materials by skilled individuals rather than mass-produced by underpaid laborers."
0,41,San Francisco,White,40-60,"For me the key components that distinguish a luxury brand are (1) quality of craftsmanship, (2) an evolved, unique design aesthetic, (3) rarity/exclusiveness of items, and (4) incredible service both during and after purchase. Those things likely translate into higher priced items but high prices without underlying value isn't luxury."
0,26,San Francisco,White,Under 40,I think Luxury Fashion is a statement piece that you curate and plan to pass down.
1,33,San Francisco,Asian,Under 40,"Classic, beautiful pieces."
1,36,Santa Monica,White,Under 40,The feel of the store when you walk in. Designer stores make you feel special and the quality of the clothes / shoes / handbags makes you feel good.

Luxury fashion brands are timeless, high quality, and send a statement about my personality. More specifically, a wardrobe defines you, what you tolerate, what you love, and how you think about yourself."
1,49,Seattle,White,40-60,"Quality materials, often made in Europe using old world techniques. Originality, durability."
0,44,Seattle,None,40-60,"For me a luxury brand means superb quality, exquisite craftsmanship, items that stand the test of time and something I will be able to use and enjoy for a long time. Luxury brands like Hermès prides itself with only giving the highest quality products, most of them handmade by an artisan, guaranteeing the best of the best. Luxury brands tend to stand the test of time, retaining its value over time (or in the case of Chanel and Hermes classics, value increases in time). It also means exclusivity and tend to have a smaller but more discerning following. Luxury brand aficionados love the heritage/history of each house and appreciate all the hard work that goes into it. Other fashion brands on the other hand are like fast fashion, they cater to trends, what sells now. The quality is not that great, most are mass produced,  and very accessible to everyone. Fashion brands tend to cater to seasonality anf trends, something you can enjoy for months or a few years (depending on the quality). For fashion brands, the heritage/history does not matter as much."
0,28,Tucson,White,Under 40,Quality of luxury brands are better. The history and craftsman’s ship are superior. The exclusivity of luxury is also important. It’s nice to have unique things that you don’t see everyone owning.
1,41,Washington D.C.,Asian,40-60,High price point. Long history and tradition of the fashion house. High level of quality and craftsmanship. Exclusivity and not available to the masses.
0,43,Washington D.C.,White,40-60,Luxury has history. The story of the design and the fashion house have value and the quality of the goods are higher.
0,26,Washington D.C.,White,Under 40,"A luxury fashion brand is more exclusive than a regular fashion brand. Typically, these brands are setting the standards for current trends rather than following them. The quality of these products (such as that of the fabrics used) is much higher than those of a regular fashion brand, and said products are valued higher cost due to their uniqueness and creative design. Many of the styles implemented by luxury fashion brands are timeless and are fashionable throughout many generations due to their prestige."
0,56,Washington D.C.,White,40-60,"When I was a little girl I used to imagine myself walking down Fifth Avenue and looking into the windows at Tiffany’s and Saks Fifth Avenue. I dreamt of one day being able to wear what I saw in the windows. Today I am still that little girl but I am now wearing the things I used to imagine.  What differentiates designer clothing from other fashion brands is how it makes you feel when you put it on or carry, the workmanship that is behind what you are putting on or carrying, and the fabric/materials used by the designers. Saying that what is luxury to one is not luxury to another. It is a personal preference – for me it is always being that little girl imagining what could be when looking into  the windows at Tiffany’s and Saks Fifth Avenue."
