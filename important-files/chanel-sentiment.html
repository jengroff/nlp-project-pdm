      <td>For me personally what differentiates a luxury fashion brand are several factors. First and foremost is quality, the durability of an item is dependent on the quality of the item. I always research the materials the item is made out of not only for my personal knowledge but also to know what I am buying, how to care for it, durability, and if I am getting ripped off. I like to make sure that the luxury item I am paying for is actually luxurious and not cheaply made with cheap materials. I also like to make sure that if I am spending a lot of money I want it to be on something that is timeless and can last for my daughters to one day inherit. Another thing that is important to me is customer service, how you are treated at the store and if they have good service. I also like the items to be exclusive and not something everyone can get their hands on. I also like to buy from brands that have a fair return policy in case I don‚Äôt end up liking the item. But the biggest thing after quality has to be customer service. It has happened that I go into a store wanting to buy an item but if I am not treated correctly and nicely by the sales associate I will not buy anything. It also is really frustrating to get a sales associate who doesn‚Äôt know much about the brand.</td>

So even when they sell something casual, like T shirts or even a pair of socks, I would trust them with their quality as well as the design and after-care. Yes, they are more expensive so people might think they‚Äôd better be good, and in most cases in my opinion they actually are more than good. They are the top runner of the trend, they have pride and belief in their products and their passion to please and satisfy their clients always impress me and make me want to go back to the same brands.</td>

      <td>The differentiating qualities of a luxury fashion brand includes source materials, design, quality of construction, service delivery and client relationship building. Luxury fashion sources the best materials to create the product. These materials have a more pleasing feel and look, longevity and wear better than non-luxury brands. The design aspects of luxury stems from the creative minds at the helm of the various fashion brands. Luxury fashion creates the look while non-luxury follows the look. Quality of construction and fit sets apart luxury fashion from the rest. Luxury items are made with care and it shows from the pattern, fit and finish...just doesn't compare. Finally, service delivery and relationship building is at the core of luxury. The presentation of the final product and treatment of clientele creates an experience. Luxury shopping should be an experience of enjoyment and echo the brands' overall image and be relatable to the client.</td>

      <td>For me a luxury brand means superb quality, exquisite craftsmanship, items that stand the test of time and something I will be able to use and enjoy for a long time. Luxury brands like Herm√®s prides itself with only giving the highest quality products, most of them handmade by an artisan, guaranteeing the best of the best. Luxury brands tend to stand the test of time, retaining its value over time (or in the case of Chanel and Hermes classics, value increases in time). It also means exclusivity and tend to have a smaller but more discerning following. Luxury brand aficionados love the heritage/history of each house and appreciate all the hard work that goes into it.¬†Other fashion brands on the other hand are like fast fashion, they cater to trends, what sells now. The quality is not that great, most are mass produced, ¬†and very accessible to everyone. Fashion brands tend to cater to seasonality anf trends, something you can enjoy for months or a few years (depending on the quality). For fashion brands, the heritage/history does not matter as much.</td>

We are often made to feel special and important whenever we shop, answering all our questions and being patient with us, especially during the pandemic when going to the store was not possible. Talking or texting my SA helped a lot! Luxury brands also know how to zhush up their Classic collections based on trends with limited-editions and collabs!

Splurge - the item will be more expensive than other items and will add a feeling of luxe that will elevate any outfit. Overall brand identity - the brand will carefully curate its messaging so that I will feel proud to be associated with the brand and those that wear it.\nInventiveness - the brand will seek to explore new ideas and styles, and to set the trends years in advance, and will not be content to simply follow the mainstream. Design - the item will be designed to feature thoughtful details and features that are unique and will be useful to or delight the wearer. Experience - the experience of purchasing the item will be a pleasure from start to finish, from stepping into the store, whether to browse or ultimately purchase. There is a feeling that the brand seeks to build a lasting relationship to which the buyer wants to return again and again, not a short term sales transaction.</td>

What style or image are they trying to portray through the combined collection of bags, clothes, shoes, etc? That‚Äôs an important question. I also think having an original and unique style also is important. For example, I‚Äôve seen a few brands copy Herm√®s Kelly or Chanel classic flap and it makes me feel like this brand that copies others hasn‚Äôt really matured yet. Finally, I consider investment value. I‚Äôm always updating my closet and my style has changed from my Asians to early 30s. I never buy with the intention to sell, but I am conscious that my style might be in the middle of changing so I keep abreast of how easily the bag sells and whether or not it can hold its value.\nRecently I‚Äôve noticed handbag quality of brands like Chanel and Herm√®s have been inconsistent. It‚Äôs made me reconsider paying a premium. If I want a green bag, I may just buy a different brand. I find dior and fendi to be ‚Äúedgier‚Äù now</td>

Clearly myself and others at our income level tend to shop in stores such as Bergdorf‚Äôs and Saks where you can only purchase luxury labels. I really feel social media has fueled people‚Äôs desires to obtain label status even at lower income levels.</td>

Those things likely translate into higher priced items but high prices without underlying value isn't luxury.</td>
