2,"In your opinion, what differentiates a luxury fashion brand (selling designer clothing, handbags, shoes, etc.) from other fashion brands? _Please give as much detail as possible in your answer! Thank you!_",,Well made. Unique pieces that you won’t see every day. High end fashion. Good customer service in store. Forever pieces.,The designer pieces are more creative and timeless. The quality is superior. They can be an investment (for example Chanel or Hermes bags) and could be passed through generation.,Timeless and ageless styles are the main reason I shop for the luxury fashion brands. For example I feel always so proud and happy to carry my 20+years handbags from Hermès ( Kelly 35 sellier to be specific). Hermès also releases some new styles of handbags but they usually variate in sizes ( minis are very hot now). I used to love Louis Vuitton but as they explore too many styles in printing ( monogram with some designs) I began to avoid such items as I feel carrying them is outdated.,"When I was a little girl I used to imagine myself walking down Fifth Avenue and looking into the windows at Tiffany’s and Saks Fifth Avenue. I dreamt of one day being able to wear what I saw in the windows. Today I am still that little girl but I am now wearing the things I used to imagine.  What differentiates designer clothing from other fashion brands is how it makes you feel when you put it on or carry, the workmanship that is behind what you are putting on or carrying, and the fabric/materials used by the designers. Saying that what is luxury to one is not luxury to another. It is a personal preference – for me it is always being that little girl imagining what could be when looking into  the windows at Tiffany’s and Saks Fifth Avenue.",Luxury brands are timeless and classic and can have an edge all at the same time. It makes you personally feel good wearing a designer brand,"The luxury designer clothing,shoes,bags quality is for lifetime and always look classy and in style","IMO the 3 major fashion conglomerates that produce 90% of the Luxury market share factories. They buy product product in China and assemble in Italy therefor being able to say the item was made in Italy. Kering, LVMH, Richemont.

Hermes and Chanel are still independent which shows in its quality and value retention.

When I buy a Birkin it’s going to keep, if not double or triple in value. When I buy a YSL Tote I’m losing my money and the item will soon be out of style.

Same with Chanel Classics. The price may be INSANE but the item will last for years and so will the style. I cannot say the same for Chloe, Givenchy, Gucci or Dolce and Gabbana Bags.",I think the main difference is the unique designs that you get from Luxury fashion houses as well as the quality. I still use my Chanel jumbo from 15 years ago for instance.,"Quality of fabric or leather, workmanship as well as designs. I like classic things that last longer.
B",A luxury brand is more timeless than a run of the mill brand with better materials and overall quality. The pieces are well constructed and last for years. A lot of luxury items tend to have logos so that fashionistas can show off but I am much more about the quality and want subtle logos on my luxury items.,"Couture houses, grew up looking at luxury fashion brands in Vogue.",Exclusivity. Limited quantities produced.,Luxury fashion brands don’t copy and come out with original pieces that the others brands aspire to. They are the creative force behind the over all look of the moment. They also tend to be timeless in design and value .,"In my opinion the quality of the luxury brand is what makes the difference.
Louis Vuitton Neverfull","The attention to detail, the superior craftsmanship, the higher quality and uniqueness of the materials, be it fabrics, leathers or metals, the originality of the designs, the limited supply.","Exclusivity, quality and craftsmanship. The history and prestige of the brand. A luxury brand will offer a consumer a unique and impeccable shopping experience.  Being able to build relationships with my SA’s throughout the different luxury brands that I shop at is something I don’t get with other brands","Designer brands are statement piece. They give me confidence, and tell the world, “I’ve made it”. The quality is unmatched and I consider all my luxury brands an investment.","I believe you get what you pay for! Though luxury brands are not for everyone, I admire the exemplary craftsmanship and style they afford me. I prefer to spend more on a timeless, classic item that will transcend seasons than buy trend. Additionally, luxury brand are easily identified. When I choose an additional piece for my collection, it’s almost like an adrenaline rush!
Opinion",Luxury fashion brand stands for exquisite quality and high standards.,"I think luxury brands are more about catering to classic and timeless designs. You can wear these brands anytime and almost anywhere and their easily recognizable and makes your whole outfit chic! I also love the fact that luxury items now hold much of their value particularly bags like chanel or Hermes. Some are even considered investment pieces . I also love VIP treatment of SA’s and the houses themselves to clients like us. We are often made to feel special and important whenever we shop, answering all our questions and being patient with us, especially during the pandemic when going to the store was not possible. Talking or texting my SA helped a lot! Luxury brands also know how to zhush up their Classic collections based on trends with limited-editions and collabs! It makes you covet more from a particular house all the time!","The details make the difference to me. Soft satin lining a jacket, a zipper that moves smoothly, stitching that doesn’t come loose.....","Quality, exclusivity, style","A luxury brand has good quality materials, good fit, identifiable brand style or logo, proper packaging/presentation and excellent service that presents a memorable boutique experience.","What differentiates luxury fast brands from other fashion brands is 1) the style, which I find to be more distinctive/unique, and 2) the craftsmanship, which i find to be more detailed & intricate.","Gucci tote
Luxury fashion brands are timeless, high quality, and send a statement about my personality. More specifically, a wardrobe defines you, what you tolerate, what you love, and how you think about yourself.","Luxury brand usually has more details. Also seasonal designs which are unique. Chanel has their fantasy tweed which is a really beautiful handwork piece. Dior likes their feminine soluette with the waist altered smaller and Dior’s knit work and crochet handwork are gorgeous.
Chanel and Hermès handbags last a long time! The stitching is tight and don’t come lose. Leather doesn’t peel.",Craftsmanship and exclusivity,"Statement pieces that will be around for a long time, quality","I always feel special when wearing a designer piece, more confident. I like to treat myself to pieces that make me feel good and that I look forward to wearing!","Quality & timeless appeal. Wearability and durability. Best stitching, best craftsmanship. Each piece is it’s own little work of art. Also, not mass produced. Each line every season will eventually become obsolete.","Quality of material, design, history, scarcity","Creativity, Design, Attention to detail and marketing, these differentiates the brands from one another and make them more desirable.","Luxury brands are exclusive. They have impeccable craftsmanship. It's a high level, or should be a high level experience when you purchase in the brand's boutiques. Service is very personalized.","I have a distinct taste and one that is not easily replicated.
I like having a style that reflects my personal lifestyle, and also having items coveted by others.",Luxury items are life long items. I have started my collection of designer items since my 20s and I still wear items that are 30+ years old. Old styles always come back! I love my luxury items!,I think the quality of many of the designer items I have is better than some of my other garments. The expensive pieces that I buy look good for years. I only buy classic pieces so my things are timeless. I still where a chanel bag that I got 30 years ago. I treat my designer things well and I'm very careful with them. I also buy these things because I admit to liking the status and wearing these things makes me feel a bit more special and can give me a lift.,"The quality , the craftsmanship of the product",The quality of designer brands vs non-designer brands is what separates designer pieces from the rest. You can see the quality in the stitching and materials that are used to make designer pieces. Designer clothing have a more tailored fit than clothing pieces that are not of a designer brand. I also love the fact that certain designer pieces are timeless and actually appreciate in value over time. You can have designer bags that last year after year and never goes out of style.,Quality and investment. I like the way things look,"It's the quality and craftsmanship. It's exclusivity. To me, luxury doesn't mean that everyone can get it. It's also great service.","I view certain designer brands as timeless and an “asset” for my wardrobe. I think about how I want to wear each piece for 5-10 years, and how good I feel wearing it even if the cost per wear is high. Other fashion brands come and go for me, and I don’t expect to wear them for more than a season or two. In the last 5 years, I have tried really hard not to buy other brands and only use it to fill a void which designer brands don’t have such as a plain white T or denim or a passing trend.","There is a reason why there is a cache attached to Luxury fashion--it's fit, quality and structure I find to be far superior. Also these brands retain their value. Almost like a commodity on the stock exchange. That is the selling point I should tell my husband 🤣. I also love that when you purchase a luxury clothing item not everyone is wearing it--I like to have my own kind of style and enjoy wearing pieces that are not as easy to come by. Designers aren't mass producing these items. And they are made more personally. Stitching by hand, almost like it's made just for me. If that makes sense.","The unique touches such as the type and placement of hardware or a design/pattern indicating within which season it was purchased. Also the timeless of Chanel, the versatility of Louis Vuitton & the trendiness of Gucci. Each luxury brand has a touch that differentiates it from another brand.","In my opinion, what differentiates a luxury fashion brand are the quality material and craftsmanship. Also just as important, the shopping experience from the interaction and training of store associates, follow up and aftermarket sales when necessary, and the overall experience with the brand.","For me these purchases are an investment, great quality than of the less expensive brands the craftsmanship, the fit.","A luxury brand is an evolving art. It represents centuries of traditions, incredible craftsmanship, timeless, undeniably recognizable classic and unique collectors/museum pieces. The fashion houses of Hermès, Chanel, Dior, etc endeavor to create a catered buying experience. I value a special connection with a Luxury Boutique Management, SAs, Alterations and Post Sale services. It seems a luxury brand appreciates not only my purchasing power but loyalty and knowledge of collections.","Details differentiate a luxury fashion brand from other fashion brands.

For example: How seams are finished inside the garment.

Materials used for hardware.

Something about the luxury item should not be replicable. 

The brand and it's products must be Top of class and deliver some meaningful or measurable value like Innovation, Exclusivity, Heritage, Relevance.","New Gucci shoes and socks
The quality of items is the major difference between high end luxury items and brands. They do not lose much in value.",Luxury has history. The story of the design and the fashion house have value and the quality of the goods are higher.,"High quality, exclusiveness, prestige, accumulated value over time","Quality, unique design, history and mystique of the fashion house
Seeing famous or beautiful people on IG wear the outfits
Knowing the company supports charitable causes","quality, customer service",The quality of craftsmanship. The on point trends. The cachet of the name and what it stands for.,"Craftsmanship, fabrics/materials, artisans, heritage of brand","Sets a standard. Exclusive. Feeling good and special when wearing the item.
LV Bag",I just love the quality of the products as well as the classic styles. I have new trendy pieces as well as classics that I’ve held into for years that still look brand new. I love how it can fit trends for both young and old as I just purchased gucci jewelry as well for my daughters high school graduation gift ❤️,I feel like a luxury brand can change the entire dynamics of any outfit. You could wear a sweatshirt and leggings from target but If you have a Chanel bag or a luxury brand it automatically changes the entire vibe of your style and or outfit. It makes you feel more confident & put together regardless of what you have on.,Quality over quantity. Style offered. Timeless pieces.,"I strongly believe that the luxury brands are fully aware of their value of the “brand names” and their influences on the society. So even when they sell something casual, like T shirts or even a pair of socks, I would trust them with their quality as well as the design and after-care. Yes, they are more expensive so people might think they’d better be good, and in most cases in my opinion they actually are more than good. They are the top runner of the trend, they have pride and belief in their products and their passion to please and satisfy their clients always impress me and make me want to go back to the same brands.","Quality, craftsmanship and longevity, timeless","Quality materials, often made in Europe using old world techniques.

Attention to design and detail

Those fadhion brands have Been around forever, They area classic And not trendy..","I think a luxury brand is different from other brands for several reasons. First being exclusivity: it’s harder to attain and it’s typically at a higher price point that not all can attain. Second being quality:
The quality is typically higher than everyday to mid price brands.

Third being service: there is an expectation of a higher level of service from luxury brands than everyday brands.","Quality of products. ""Limited"" - do not want to spend $$$ if everyone can buy.","Exclusivity - the item I buy won't be easy to find or for others to find. Quality - the construction will be the finest and made to last a long time. Taste - the item will be one that will be in good taste even if it is avant garde or not yet in fashion. Uniqueness - the item will reflect a certain style or aesthetic that the particular brand is known for and will be in character with the identity of the brand. Splurge - the item will be more expensive than other items and will add a feeling of luxe that will elevate any outfit. Overall brand identity - the brand will carefully curate its messaging so that I will feel proud to be associated with the brand and those that wear it.
Inventiveness - the brand will seek to explore new ideas and styles, and to set the trends years in advance, and will not be content to simply follow the mainstream. Design - the item will be designed to feature thoughtful details and features that are unique and will be useful to or delight the wearer. Experience - the experience of purchasing the item will be a pleasure from start to finish, from stepping into the store, whether to browse or ultimately purchase. There is a feeling that the brand seeks to build a lasting relationship to which the buyer wants to return again and again, not a short term sales transaction.",High price point. Long history and tradition of the fashion house. High level of quality and craftsmanship. Exclusivity and not available to the masses.,"A luxury fashion brand uses the highest quality material, expert workmanship and you can see this in the details of the finished product . In addition there is a timelessness to the styling that is unmistakable.","Luxury brands focus on the total elevated experience for the customers. The store, ambiance, the staff, every detail that includes elevated shopping bags and gift wrap. The pieces are special not mainstream. Shopping luxury brands creates a “rush” for me. A special gift that I prefer not to see everyone having.","The differentiating qualities of a luxury fashion brand includes source materials, design, quality of construction, service delivery and client relationship building. Luxury fashion sources the best materials to create the product. These materials have a more pleasing feel and look, longevity and wear better than non-luxury brands. The design aspects of luxury stems from the creative minds at the helm of the various fashion brands. Luxury fashion creates the look while non-luxury follows the look. Quality of construction and fit sets apart luxury fashion from the rest. Luxury items are made with care and it shows from the pattern, fit and finish...just doesn't compare. Finally, service delivery and relationship building is at the core of luxury. The presentation of the final product and treatment of clientele creates an experience. Luxury shopping should be an experience of enjoyment and echo the brands' overall image and be relatable to the client.",Quality of the product,"For me it’s all about the feel of the fabrics , the aesthetics of the look.

Luxury is custom and can’t be duplicated.","I think you really can tell the difference in quality by touching, looking at stitching , weight and look of it says it all.

It takes a lot of craft-man ship to get this done.","For me a luxury brand means superb quality, exquisite craftsmanship, items that stand the test of time and something I will be able to use and enjoy for a long time. Luxury brands like Hermès prides itself with only giving the highest quality products, most of them handmade by an artisan, guaranteeing the best of the best. Luxury brands tend to stand the test of time, retaining its value over time (or in the case of Chanel and Hermes classics, value increases in time). It also means exclusivity and tend to have a smaller but more discerning following. Luxury brand aficionados love the heritage/history of each house and appreciate all the hard work that goes into it. Other fashion brands on the other hand are like fast fashion, they cater to trends, what sells now. The quality is not that great, most are mass produced,  and very accessible to everyone. Fashion brands tend to cater to seasonality anf trends, something you can enjoy for months or a few years (depending on the quality). For fashion brands, the heritage/history does not matter as much.",Luxury fashion brands have quality and craftsmanship that differentiates them from other brands. They are so trend setters.,"For me the key components that distinguish a luxury brand are (1) quality of craftsmanship, (2) an evolved, unique design aesthetic, (3) rarity/exclusiveness of items, and (4) incredible service both during and after purchase. Those things likely translate into higher priced items but high prices without underlying value isn't luxury.",Quality of the materials and the construction. I like the idea of “investment” pieces.,I would say unfortunately the label. It’s a status symbol for our income level. Clearly myself and others at our income level tend to shop in stores such as Bergdorf’s and Saks where you can only purchase luxury labels. I really feel social media has fueled people’s desires to obtain label status even at lower income levels.,"The high quality, craftsmanship and uncompromised style. There’s nothing like the feeling you get from buying a luxury piece and every time you wear it - so much joy.","Quality, unique design and designer reputation. I enjoy quality, unique pieces in my wardrobe that are distinct and not mass produced. I will buy trendy, everyday clothing too but they are disposable. The classic designer, luxury items I purchase are keepers and considered investments. I appreciate the experience of shopping in a boutique to see displays and styling of clothes. You get more personal attention though sometimes I prefer to be left alone to browse.","I find that luxury brands fabric and the way it fits and feels there is a very big difference between a high end brand and other fashion brands. It just forms to the body differently and feels better on a women’s body. I truly believe that spending a bit more money is worth it due to longevity as well. Price is what you pay , value is what you get !","Design: each luxury fashion brand has timeless design. Chanel: four pocket design jacket, quilted bag, chain, camellia

Gucci: 3 colors tape,

Christian Dior: forget me nuts, the silhouette(high small waist)

Fendi: two color (beige and black), stripe, beautiful fur collection

Quality is high! you see the excellent craftsmanship. Their pieces are masterpieces:

Chanel: tweed is leakage, details of thread and material is very selected, fashion Jewelly is also very well created

Fendi: their fur collection or fur trimmed coat are outstanding looks and color is amazing

Their monster collection becomes hip and cool for the men

So we know there is a value for the each of merchandise.

There is also much more attention to detail and better craftsmanship secondary to the fact that it’s usually handmade as opposed to mass produced.,A luxury fashion brand offers a quality and style above and beyond what you will find at a “typical” retailer. The designers at prestigious fashion houses are creating pieces of art so when I add to my collection it is more than just a garment or accessory.,"To me, the difference between luxury fashion and regular fashion is the quality and the exclusivity. Luxury items have a longer life because they are made better and designers stand behind their items, so if there is a problem they are more apt to make it right.

A luxury fashion brand have beautiful boutique where you don’t just shop, you get to experience the brand lifestyle.

Iconic in the sense that when you look at a piece of item, you can easily identify the brand. Some great examples of that would be the Chanel classic flap, Louboutins red sole, the Lonchamp tote, and Mulberry bayswater. The second important factor for me is quality. It has to be made to last and the item must have flawless craftsmanship. These are the two things that are important to me when it comes to luxury brands.","A luxury brand is about craftsmanship, exclusivity, a feeling of belonging to a club that not everyone can belong to. When you wear them, you’re treated with respect and when you shop for them, you’re treated to an experience. Sales Associates know you by name and know what you like.

The artistic aspect of the designs and attention to detail tend to be much better.","Price and exclusivity, knowing that not everyone will be able to buy it. Also that pieces are limited so even if you have money to buy it it’s not available. What makes Hermès so appealing to me is that even of you have the money to buy it doesn’t mean you will get it.

Also, the quality of fabric and material used in luxury fashion brands have a different feel than of others.","Luxury fashion brands typically provide the highest quality, fit, cut, and elegance, not to mention style.","The most important quality that differentiates a fashion brand is the overall feel of the brand. What style or image are they trying to portray through the combined collection of bags, clothes, shoes, etc? That’s an important question. I also think having an original and unique style also is important. For example, I’ve seen a few brands copy Hermès Kelly or Chanel classic flap and it makes me feel like this brand that copies others hasn’t really matured yet. Finally, I consider investment value. I’m always updating my closet and my style has changed from my 20s to early 30s. I never buy with the intention to sell, but I am conscious that my style might be in the middle of changing so I keep abreast of how easily the bag sells and whether or not it can hold its value.
Recently I’ve noticed handbag quality of brands like Chanel and Hermès have been inconsistent. It’s made me reconsider paying a premium. If I want a green bag, I may just buy a different brand. I find dior and fendi to be “edgier” now",The craftsmanship/quality. The history. The unique and distinctive designs that catch people’s eye when you’re walking by.

The craftsmanship will continue to make me a collector for life!","The main differentiating factor of a luxury fashion brand is the quality of product that you are receiving. Simply touching a designer leather purse, you can feel how soft the high quality material is compared to any other brand. The luxury brands have a well-established reputation of providing superior products and innovative design that other brands can not provide. Every little detail, such as the seamwork of an article of clothing, is executed so perfectly that the items are more durable (if treated appropriately). The luxury brands also offer the individual a sense of status and uniqueness.","The brand strategy for luxury brands is different than other fashion brands. Luxury doesn’t meet a need or solve a problem, and so it is intrinsically wrong to position a luxury brand based on how it compares to its competitors. Luxury consumers aren’t interested in more features giving better value for money – that’s a premium marketing angle. Luxury consumers want to know about a brand’s heritage, prestige and uniqueness; it’s identity which counts, rather than a competitive edge.",The quality of the item.

Because some luxury items are hard to get and find easily in stores is why I want them. It’s different from fashion brands that available everywhere.,Value in the brand. Luxury items are something that hold their value really well. We’ve seen this with a lot of styles resurfacing (ie Prada re-edition and dior saddle are both bags I had in high school and now I’m in my 30s and they’re back in style). The quality is long lasting and something I would hope to pass on to my daughters one day. Luxury items are classics and never go out of style like trendy items and they carry sentimental value. For instance I have a silk Oscar de la renta scarf my mom passed down to me. One day I hope she will also let go of her lady dior bag!,I believe that quality and elegance of luxury brands are what makes them different. Luxury fashion brands are typically trend setters and other brands follow from them so I enjoy the originality,The pieces are classic and withstand time.

Ie a Chanel tweed blazer,"A luxury fashion brand is something that lasts because it is made with great quality materials.They last generations and I hope to pass all of my luxury items to my offspring one day. The quality honestly speaks for itself. I have a Chanel bag that was handed down to me from my great aunt and it is still my favorite piece. Luxury brands cannot be afforded by all because they are exclusive and that exclusivity makes them even more desired and sought after. There is a reason people wait months to years for their item of their dreams, it is because those items make people not only look great but they also feel great. I love how I feel when i have a new luxury piece to add to my collection.","I always find classic pieces that I can wear year after year. I'm not the biggest fan of fast trends, so I like investing in classic pieces that I'll have for a long time (due to quality) and because they'll never go out of style.

Where Luxury designer items are original ideas other fashion brands are just taking concepts - not original.,"I believe a luxury fashion brands are good investment pieces that offers quality, uniqueness and holds resale value.","A luxury fashion brand is defined by its price point, its client base, and its history. To me, a luxury fashion brand has been around for a while. In terms of price, a luxury brand is not affordable and should not be considered attainable- I find that bags and shoes are usually the luxury items people save up for, while luxury clothing is worn only by those who own many luxury pieces.

First and foremost is quality, the durability of an item is dependent on the quality of the item. I always research the materials the item is made out of not only for my personal knowledge but also to know what I am buying, how to care for it, durability, and if I am getting ripped off. I like to make sure that the luxury item I am paying for is actually luxurious and not cheaply made with cheap materials.
